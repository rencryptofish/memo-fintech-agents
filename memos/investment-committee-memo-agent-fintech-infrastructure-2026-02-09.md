# Investment Committee Memo: Agent-Fintech Infrastructure

Date: February 9, 2026
Prepared For: Investment Committee
Prepared By: Research Team (Fintech + Agent Economy Synthesis)

## Decision Request

Approve a focused 12-month theme allocation to agent-fintech infrastructure, centered on identity/compliance and cross-rail orchestration, with strict evidence gates before scaling position sizes.

## What Changed After Full Repo Audit

1. The strategic direction is intact, but confidence in several headline metrics should be reduced.
2. Fintech VC recovery is real, but magnitude depends on baseline: 2025 at $51.8B is +27% versus a $40.8B baseline and +19.4% versus a $43.4B baseline.
3. x402 traction appears directionally meaningful (large transaction count), but volume quality is uncertain and some underlying time-series points are estimated.
4. Certain M&A claims in prior drafts should be treated as unverified until confirmed by primary sources; do not underwrite theses on rumor-based exits.

## Updated Thesis

Value is most likely to accrue to control points, not commodity pipes.

1. Compliance and identity remain the strongest moat candidates as autonomous transaction volume grows.
2. Cross-protocol orchestration remains the largest visible whitespace, but we should assume incumbents can enter quickly.
3. B2B agent-finance workflows should scale before B2C autonomy due to trust, audit, and liability constraints.
4. Crypto and fiat rails are likely complementary; winning infrastructure must abstract across both.
5. Facilitator-only models show weak defensibility; facilitator plus compliance/policy bundles may still be investable.

## Base-Rate Evidence (Added Feb 9, 2026)

1. Market size is large enough for control-point winners: global payments generated ~$2.5T revenue on ~$2.0 quadrillion flows in 2024.
2. Rail migration is slow even when infrastructure is live: ACH still processed $93T in 2025; RTP needed years to pass $1T cumulative value; FedNow had 1,192 institutions but only 1.5M transactions in 2024.
3. Existing friction and fraud are already large: 70.19% checkout abandonment, $33.41B global card fraud losses, and $12.5B reported US consumer fraud losses.
4. Stablecoins are now material but still compliance-sensitive: $300B+ supply and ~$46T raw (~$9T adjusted) annualized transfer volume, with persistent illicit-risk monitoring requirements.

## Probability-Weighted Outcomes to 2030

1. **55%: Hybrid default.** Fiat rails remain dominant for consumer-facing checkout while stablecoins grow in backend settlement and machine-native payments.
2. **30%: Multi-rail equilibrium.** Routing/orchestration platforms become the key value-capture layer across card, bank, and stablecoin rails.
3. **10%: Crypto-first mainstream.** Stablecoins become the default rail for broad agent commerce beyond niche use cases.
4. **5%: Delayed adoption.** Regulatory, liability, and fraud frictions materially slow autonomous-finance penetration.

## Crypto Rail Decision Lens

Advantages:
1. Better small-ticket economics (illustrative: $1 card payment fee ~32.9c versus ~1.5c stablecoin fee at 1.5%).
2. Faster 24/7 settlement for global machine-to-machine and cross-border workflows.
3. Higher programmability for policy-driven agent transactions.

Disadvantages:
1. Weaker default consumer protection and dispute frameworks than card networks.
2. Higher compliance integration burden across jurisdictions.
3. Lower mainstream merchant acceptance and user familiarity.

## Priority Questions Before Scaling Capital

1. What share of agent payment volume is organic utility traffic versus speculative traffic, using a reproducible method?
2. Which team can own policy and identity across rails without being platform-dependent on one incumbent?
3. What are real, company-level unit economics (gross margin, retention, payback), not market-level TAM narratives?
4. Which jurisdictions will define practical KYA/KYC requirements first, and who is already license-ready?
5. Is orchestration genuinely greenfield, or already being absorbed by large payment networks and cloud platforms?

## Where To Invest

Prioritize companies meeting at least two criteria:

1. Regulatory/compliance moat (licenses, controls, audit infrastructure).
2. Cross-rail and cross-protocol abstraction capability.
3. Deep workflow/data integration with enterprise financial operations.
4. Clear production traction with paying enterprise customers.

Priority buckets:

1. Tier 1: Identity/compliance infrastructure and orchestration control-plane plays.
2. Tier 2: Enterprise agent-finance applications with proprietary data/workflow lock-in.
3. Tier 3: Discovery/marketplace bets only where early network effects are demonstrated.

## Where Not To Invest

1. Standalone facilitator businesses without compliance, policy, or enterprise workflow differentiation.
2. Thin wallet/payment wrappers with no distribution, data, or regulatory moat.
3. Consumer-first autonomy bets that require unresolved trust and liability assumptions.
4. Deals justified primarily by unverified acquisition rumors.

## Risk Controls

1. Evidence risk: treat estimated market metrics as directional, not underwriting-grade.
2. Platform risk: assume aggressive bundling from large incumbents.
3. Timing risk: require capital-efficient burn and near-term revenue proof.
4. Regulatory risk: prioritize operators built for auditability and policy enforcement from day one.

## 12-Month Go/No-Go Milestones

1. Measurable increase in organic agent transaction volume (not speculation-led).
2. Compliance and agent identity spend appearing as explicit budget line items in enterprise RFPs.
3. At least one orchestration platform showing repeatable production routing across rails.
4. Demonstrated willingness to pay for policy, authorization, and audit controls.
5. One breakout company with durable moat plus repeatable distribution.

## Recommendation

Proceed, but stage capital. Start with a concentrated watchlist and small initial checks, then scale only when data quality and production traction clear the above milestones.
