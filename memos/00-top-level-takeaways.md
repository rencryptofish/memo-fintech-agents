# Top-Level Takeaways (Start Here)

**Purpose:** This is the top-level memo for the repository. If you read one file first, read this one.
**Date:** February 2026 (updated with repo-wide synthesis)

## What Matters Most

1. The highest-conviction investment zone is **agent-fintech infrastructure**, especially identity, compliance, and orchestration layers.
2. **Protocol fragmentation is real** (x402, ACP, AP2, TAP, UCP, Agent Pay), creating a large need for cross-rail abstraction.
3. **B2B adoption is leading B2C** because enterprise workflows have clearer ROI and governance paths.
4. **Crypto and fiat rails are likely complementary**, not winner-take-all.
5. **Regulation is a moat**, not just a cost center.
6. **Facilitator-only payment models are vulnerable** without compliance/policy/workflow differentiation.
7. The strongest open whitespace remains **cross-protocol orchestration** and **agent service discovery**.
8. Data quality varies across the corpus; several headline metrics are directional and require diligence before hard underwriting.
