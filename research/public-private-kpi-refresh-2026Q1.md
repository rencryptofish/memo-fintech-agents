## C) Private KPI Coverage Gaps (Needs Primary Evidence)

| Company | Common Memo Claim | Current Verification State | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Ramp | Valuation and revenue growth claims | secondary-only in current packet | refresh via latest financing docs or company primary disclosures |
| Mercury | Valuation and profitability claims | secondary-only in current packet | refresh from primary interviews/filings if available |
| Sardine | ARR growth and valuation | secondary-only | require primary press release or investor-confirmed source |
| BVNK | $750M valuation + acquisition interest | rumor-level | keep out of base-case until primary confirmation |
| Zero Hash | near-$1B valuation + sale talks | rumor-level | keep as watchlist only |

## Refresh Rule

1. Public-company metrics: refresh weekly.
2. Private-company valuation/revenue: refresh monthly and keep confidence tags.
3. No private KPI enters committee base case without at least one high-confidence source.
