## Project Overview

This repository contains research memos on fintech and AI agent topics. Memos are written in markdown and focus on market analysis, investment landscape, and technology trends.

## Existing Memos

- `agent-economy-memo.md` — Comprehensive research on the AI agent economy: market map, sizing, infrastructure stack, funding landscape, trends, and investment thesis
- `fintech-market-analysis.md` — Fintech market analysis
- `x402-research-memo.md` — x402 protocol research

## Conventions

- Memos are standalone markdown files in the repo root
- Use tables for structured comparisons (company data, market sizing, funding rounds)
- Include an executive summary at the top of each memo
- Cite data sources inline (e.g., Gartner, McKinsey, Menlo Ventures)
- Structure memos with clear sections: Executive Summary, Market Map, Data/Sizing, Trends, Investment Thesis, Risks, Outlook

## Research Workflow

- Use agent teams for comprehensive research memos — spawn 3-4 parallel research agents covering different angles (infra, market map, data/sizing, trends), then compile findings into a single document
- Web search is essential for current market data, funding rounds, and analyst reports
- After initial compilation, update the memo with detailed findings from all agents for accuracy
- Key data sources: Gartner, McKinsey, Menlo Ventures, Bessemer, Grand View Research, MarketsandMarkets, Crunchbase, CB Insights, a16z, Sequoia

## Key Learnings

- AI agent market data changes rapidly — always search for the latest numbers rather than relying on cached knowledge
- Valuation and ARR figures can differ significantly across sources — note the source and date for each data point
- The most useful memo structure leads with an executive summary containing the 5-7 most important takeaways with specific numbers
- Agent team research works well with 4 parallel agents: infrastructure, market map, quantitative data, and trends/outlook
